/**
 *   The SpinInfo is the base class for the spin information for the
 *   spin correlation algorithm. The implementations for different spin
 *   states inherit from this.
 *
 *   The class contains pointers to the vertex where the particle is
 *   produced and where it decays, together with methods to set/get
 *   these.
 *
 *   There are two flags decayed which store information on the state
 *   of the particle.
 *
 *   The decayed() members provides access to the _decay data member
 *   which is true if the spin density matrix required to perform the
 *   decay of a timelike particle has been calculated (this would be a
 *   decay matrix for a spacelike particle.) This is set by the
 *   decay() method which calls a method from the production vertex to
 *   calculate this matrix. The decay() method should be called by a
 *   decayer which uses spin correlation method before it uses the
 *   spin density matrix to calculate the matrix element for the
 *   decay.
 *
 *   The developed() member provides access to the _developed data
 *   member which is true if the decay matrix required to perform the
 *   decays of the siblings of a particle has been calculated (this
 *   would a spin density matrix for a spacelike particle.) This is
 *   set by the developed() method which calls a method from the decay
 *   vertex to calculate the matrix. The developed() method is called
 *   by a DecayHandler which is capable of performing spin
 *   correlations after all the unstable particles produced by a
 *   decaying particle are decayed.
 *
 *   Methods are also provided to access the spin density and decay
 *   matrices for a particle.
