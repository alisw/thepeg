/**
 * CFileLineReader is a wrapper around a standard C FILE stream. With
 * it one reads one line at the time (with readline()) into an
 * internal buffer from which one can then read as from a standard
 * std::istream with a limited set of operator>> functions. It can be
 * thought of as an std::ifstream where the internal buffer must be
 * filled by hand one line at the time.
 *
 * Contrary to std::ifstream the CFileLineReader can also handle
 * gipped files and pipes. Gzipped files are automatically handles by
 * a pipe using the <code>zcat</code> command if the file name ends
 * with <code>.gz</code>. Also if a file name ends with a
 * <code>|</code> sign, the preceding string is interpreted as a
 * command defining a pipe from which to read.
 *
 * Since CFileLineReader is very close to the standard C FILE stream
 * it is in many cases much faster than eg. reading from lines via
 * std::istringstream.
