/**
 * The Current class keeps a static stack of objects of the templated
 * class, which can be used anywhere by any class. When an object is
 * active it adds itself to the stack which can be used by any other
 * object through the static functions of the Current class. If
 * someone needs to use an alternative object a new Current object can
 * be constructed with a pointer to the desired object
 * as argument and that object will the be used by the static Current
 * functions until the Current object is destructed.
 *
 * Default-contructed objects of the Current class can be used as a
 * pointer to the currently chosen object on the stack.
 *
 * The typical use case for this class is a handler class which uses a
 * number of objects which do not have a reference back to the
 * handler, but still need to acces some member functions. In a member
 * function the handler class will construct a Current object:
 * <code>Current&lt;Handler&gt; current(this);</code> in any following
 * function called in this member function, any object can then access
 * the handlers methods as
 * <code>Current&lt;Handler&gt;()-&gt;memfun();</code>.
