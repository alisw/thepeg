/**
 * ACDCGen is a general class for sampling multi-dimensional
 * functions. ACDCGen can sample several functions simultaneously,
 * selecting different functions according to the relative
 * probabilities determined by their total integrals. The functions
 * are sampled on a unit hypercube. Function object of any class can
 * be used as long as the ACDCFncTraits class is specialized
 * correctly. ACDCFncTraits can also be used to rescale values in the
 * unit hypercube to any desired range. ACDCGen needs a random number
 * generator. Again, random number generators of any class can be used
 * as long as the ACDCRandomTraits class is specialized correctly.
 *
 * To give an unweighted samlpe ACDCGen uses a compensating
 * algorithm. Before the production sampling begins, the functions are
 * sampled randomly in the hypercube a user-defined number of times to
 * find an approximate maxumum value. The hypercube is then divided
 * into cells each of which have an approximate maximum value of the
 * function, to enable efficient sampling. The maxima are only
 * approximate though and, if a function value is found above the
 * maximum in a cell the ACDCGen will go into a compensating mode. The
 * cell is then first subdivided further and in the following this
 * cell will be over-sampled to compensate for that fact that it was
 * under-sampled before. In this way the probability of obtaining a
 * biased sample is reduced. Also rather functions with large peaks
 * are then sampled rather efficiently. Functions with narrow peaks
 * should, however, be avoided since there is no guarantee that the
 * peack is actually hit.
