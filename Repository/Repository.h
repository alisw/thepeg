 * Repository inherits from the BaseRepository class. While
 * BaseRepository is fairly general and could in principle be used for
 * any program where sets of InterfacedBase objects are managed, the
 * Repository is ThePEG specific in that it deals with ParticleData,
 * ParticleMatchers and EventGenerators.
 *
 * One main function is to write an EventGenerator to disk using
 * saveRun(). Here all objects needed for the run, including the
 * EventGenerator is cloned and isolated from the other objects in the
 * Repository (and are hence not handled by the Repository anymore)
 * before they are all persistently written out to disk.
 *
 * The Register() function simply pass the objects to the corresonding
 * method in BaseRepository, but if the object is a ParticleData or a
 * ParticleMatcher, they are stored separately.
