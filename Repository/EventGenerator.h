/**
 * The EventGenerator class manages a whole event generator run. It
 * keeps a list of all Interfaced objects which are needed for a
 * particular run (these objects each have a pointer back to the
 * EventGenerator). Some objects are special, such as a default
 * RandomGenerator object, a StandardModelBase object and a Strategy
 * object and lists of ParticleData and MatcherBase objects used in
 * the run.
 *
 * The <code>EventGenerator</code> also manages information about the
 * run such as the exceptions being thrown, files to write output and
 * error messages to, etc.
 *
 * There are three main external member functions:<BR>
 * go() generates a specified number of events and exits.<BR>
 *
 * shoot() generates one Event and returns it.<BR>
 *
 * generateEvent() takes an initial Step or a partially generated
 * Event as argument and generates subsequent steps defined in the
 * generator.<BR>
 *
 * doShoot() is a virtual function called by shoot() and may be
 * overridden in sub-classes.<BR>
 *
 * doGenrateEvent() is a virtual function called by generateEvent() and
 * may to be overridden in sub-classes.
